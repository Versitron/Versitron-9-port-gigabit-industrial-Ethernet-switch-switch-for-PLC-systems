## How to Connect an IP Camera to an Unmanaged Switch

1. **Power Supply**: Ensure the IP camera has power—either through a PoE-enabled switch port or an external power adapter.
2. **Ethernet Cable**: Connect the camera’s Ethernet port directly to any RJ45 port on the unmanaged switch.
3. **Network Configuration**: Unmanaged switches require no configuration; cameras will automatically communicate with the network.
4. **Verify Connectivity**: Check link/activity LEDs on the switch and camera to confirm connection.
5. **Access Camera Feed**: Use the camera’s IP address in your monitoring software or NVR to view the video stream.
